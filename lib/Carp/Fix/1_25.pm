=head1 NAME

Carp::Fix::1_25 - Smooth over incompatible changes in Carp 1.25

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Carp::Fix::1_25;

    carp  "This will have a period at the end, like die";
    croak "No matter what version of Carp you have installed";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Carp 1.25 made a change to its formatting, adding a period at the end
of the message.  This can mess up tests and code that are looking for
error messages.  Carp::Fix::1_25 makes the message consistent,
regardless of what version of Carp you're using.

Carp::Fix::1_25 exports its own carp functions which change the Carp
message to match the 1.25 version.  Carp::Fix::1_25 otherwise acts
exactly like Carp and it will honor L<Carp global
variables|Carp/GLOBAL VARIABLES> such as C<@CARP_NOT> and
C<%Carp::Internal>.

Why do this instead of just upgrading Carp?  Upgrading Carp would
affect all installed code all at once.  You might not be ready for
that, or you might not want your module to foist that on its users.
This lets you fix things one namespace at a time.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

The Carp which comes with 5.6.x does not have the necessary features
to support this wrapper.
