NAME
    Carp::Fix::1_25 - Smooth over incompatible changes in Carp 1.25

SYNOPSIS
        use Carp::Fix::1_25;

        carp  "This will have a period at the end, like die";
        croak "No matter what version of Carp you have installed";

DESCRIPTION
    Carp 1.25 made a change to its formatting, adding a period at the end of
    the message. This can mess up tests and code that are looking for error
    messages. Carp::Fix::1_25 makes the message consistent, regardless of
    what version of Carp you're using.

    Carp::Fix::1_25 exports its own carp functions which change the Carp
    message to match the 1.25 version. Carp::Fix::1_25 otherwise acts
    exactly like Carp and it will honor Carp global variables such as
    `@CARP_NOT' and `%Carp::Internal'.

    Why do this instead of just upgrading Carp? Upgrading Carp would affect
    all installed code all at once. You might not be ready for that, or you
    might not want your module to foist that on its users. This lets you fix
    things one namespace at a time.

KNOWN BUGS
    The Carp which comes with 5.6.x does not have the necessary features to
    support this wrapper.
